### About me:

I am a believer in Jesus Christ.
I have been married for almost 4 years and we have a beautiful son!
I love soccer, I played it my entire life.
I got started learning programming by accident, I am a chemist by trade and decided to learn python to analyze larger datasets.
I have been a Software Engineer by profession at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for about a year and a half, but I worked with programming for about 3 years prior to that in graduate school and my first job as a research technologist at St. Jude.
