### About me:

I am a believer in Jesus Christ.

I have been married for almost 4 years and we have a beautiful son!

I love soccer, I played it my entire life and even in college for the University of Memphis.

I have taken up a recent love of running! Current longest distance:
 - 14.0

I got started learning programming by accident, I am a chemist by trade and decided to learn python to analyze larger datasets.

I have been a Software Engineer by profession at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for about a year and a half, but I worked with programming for about 3 years prior to that in graduate school and my first job as a research technologist at St. Jude.

"No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it."
