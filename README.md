### About me:

I am a believer in Jesus Christ.

"No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it."
 - Hebrews 12:11

### Check me out as an Admin at the CodingDojo!
![CodingDojo](./codingdojo-logo.png)

Check out [our repository](https://github.com/codeconnector/CodingDojo) or stop by a [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/memphis-technology-user-groups) hosted by our CodeConnector parent org at 12pm CST Tuesdays.

WE:
 - Post weekly coding challenges
 - Practice white boarding the challenge
 - Pair program a solution with a more experienced Navigator and less experienced Driver
 - We will setup practice problems and test cases in the language of your choosing
 - If you don't want to drive, but just want to come hangout, all are welcome!
 - It is a safe place to learn and grow as a community

## Older Projects / Contributions

 - [PYTHON: toil cwl runner LSF memory doubling functionality](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/toil/pull/3313) - added automated memory doubling feature for jobs which fail due to memory in workflow steps up to a given number of retries - memory failures are common in genomics workflows for 3rd party tools. 
 - [PYTHON: toil cwl runner LSF9->LSF10 integration](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/toil/pull/2726) - upgraded toil batch system job scheduler for IBM SPECTRUM LSF 9 -> 10 compatibility
 - [PYTHON: toil cwl runner LSF10 memory logging](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/toil/pull/3327) - included memory logging for provenance in toil batch system job scheduler for CWL workflows and the IBM SPECTRUM LSF scheduler.
 - [PYTHON: cwltool singularity 3.x integration](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/1113) - integrated Singularity 3.x with the Common Workflow Language Runner.
 - [PYTHON: PrimerTK](https://github.com/stjude/PrimerTK) - my first ever published python project - still consistently used by 5 labs!
